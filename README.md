### Token based Auth for react on rails.

Using the gem [Knock](https://github.com/nsarno/knock) and [this medium article](https://medium.com/@nick.hartunian/knock-jwt-auth-for-rails-api-create-react-app-6765192e295a)
I added token based auth to the app Drake created with his [React on Rails screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqC589poesU)

This should be a good guide to get basic auth into your react on rails project but please reach out if you have any questions! Somethings about the medium article that we won't follow: He uses jQuery in react (yucky!) and he uses and admin flag for his users which I don't use. You may ind it useful so don't ignore it but it's not necessary.
